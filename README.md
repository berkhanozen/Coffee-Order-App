## Architecture

We use MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel) Architecture in this app. Because MVVM cleanly separates the user interface from the application logic. Divorcing one from the other improves application maintenance. It also makes application evolution easier, thereby reducing the risk of technological obsolescence.

Also we use Observer Design Pattern. Because our app has calculation and adding to cart operations. We want our app to have interactive and react quickly. So Observer Design Pattern is what we need.

The Observer Design Pattern is a software design pattern in which an object (called the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (called observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
